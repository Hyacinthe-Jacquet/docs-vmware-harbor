This topic describes how to integrate VMware Harbor Registry with Pivotal Container Service (PKS).

##<a id='provide-harbor-cert'></a>Provide the Harbor CA Certificate to Ops Manager

For Pivotal Container Service (PKS) clusters to pull images from and push images to Harbor, PKS must authenticate connections to Harbor. Consequently, you must provide the Harbor CA certificate to Ops Manager before you can use Harbor with PKS.

###<a id='get-harbor-cert'></a>Obtain the Harbor CA Certificate file

If you used a third-party CA to sign the Harbor certificate, obtain the CA certificate from your third-party CA. Otherwise, if you used an automatically generated certificate for Harbor, complete these steps:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click your username in the Ops Manager banner and select **Settings**.

1. Select the **Advanced** tab and click **Download Root CA Cert**.

###<a id='load-harbor-cert'></a>Trust the Harbor CA Certificate file

Once you have obtained the Harbor CA Certificate file, complete these steps:

1. Return to the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**. 

1. Select the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Click **Security**.

1. Open the CA certificate file in a text editor.

1. Copy and paste the contents of the CA certificate file into the **Trusted Certificates** field.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard** and click **Apply Changes**.

By adding the CA certificate that was used to sign the Harbor certificate to the Bosh Director Security configuration, all Kubernetes clusters deployed by PKS will be able to automatically trust the Harbor registry.

##<a id='ip-add'></a> Step 3: Obtain Harbor IP Address (NSX-T)

If you integrate Harbor with PKS in a NAT'ed NSX-T environment, the IP address for Harbor provided by Ops Manager is inaccessible, and you cannot access the  Harbor UI from `https://harbor_host_address:443`. 

To access the Harbor UI, you must create a DNAT rule in the T0-Router that maps the Harbor IP address to a routable IP address in your virtual network.

Follow the steps below to create this DNAT rule.

1. In the NSX Manager, select **Routing > NAT > T0-Router**.
1. Click **ADD**.
1. Configure the NAT rule as follows:
    * **Priority**: `1024`
    * **Action**: `DNAT`
    * **Protocol**: `Any Protocol`
    * **Destination IP**: The external IP address that your FQDN resolves to
    * **Translated IP**: The IP address of the Harbor VM
    * **Status**: `Enabled`
    * **Firewall Bypass**: `Enabled`

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: The IP address that your FQDN resolves to should be in the range of the NSX-T <code>external-ip-pool</code> (<strong>Inventory > Groups > IP Pools</strong>). If the IP address is not in this range, you must assign an IP address from the CIDR that is outside of the specified range in use for <code>external-ip-pool</code>.</p>
