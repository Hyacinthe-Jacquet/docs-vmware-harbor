<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: We recommend that you skip the Harbor v1.7.1 release and install or upgrade to <a href="release-notes.html#v1.7.2">Harbor v1.7.2</a>.</p>

VMware Harbor Registry v1.7.1 is a general availability release with several new features and fixes.

New features:

* Support for [Harbor Registry Release-1.7.0](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Release-1.7.0).
* Bump stemcell version to ubuntu-xenial 170.14.

Fixed issues:

* You can now change the Harbor `admin` password using the Harbor web interface. You must enter the new password in the **Admin Password to run smoke test** field of the **Credentials** pane in the Harbor tile before reinstalling or upgrading the Harbor tile.
* The parameter `registry` is added by default and does not have to be added manually to the `no_proxy` field for Clair proxy configuration.

Known issues:

When upgrading from Harbor v1.6.0 to v1.7.1, the upgrade procedure may fail with the following error message: `1 of 3 pre-start scripts failed. Failed Jobs: harbor.` The workaround is to log in to the Harbor VM with BOSH and check the Docker images. If there are any Docker images found for `vmware/harbor-log`, remove the images before migration. After removing the images, click **Apply Changes** in Ops Manager and retry the upgrade. This issue is addressed in Harbor v1.7.2. 

For guidance on logging in to the Harbor VM using BOSH, see [Managing PKS Deployments with BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/manage-deployments-bosh.html).

See the following example commands to check for Docker images in `vmare/harbor-log`:
    
```
alias docker='/var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker -H unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/dockerd.sock'
docker images | grep vmware/harbor-log
```

See the following example command to remove any Docker images found for `vmware/harbor-log`:

```    
docker rmi IMAGES-ID-OF-VMWARE/HARBOR-LOG
```
