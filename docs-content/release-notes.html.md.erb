## <a id='v1.9.2'></a> v1.9.2

**Release Date:** November 7, 2019

VMware Harbor Registry v1.9.2 is a minor release with various fixes.

### Supported Upgrade Paths

- From Harbor v1.8.x to Harbor v1.9.2
- From Harbor v1.7.x to Harbor v1.9.2
- From Harbor v1.6.x to Harbor v1.9.2

### New Features

* **Project Quotas**

   By using quota management, system administrators can set constraints that limit the number of artifacts or the amount of storage resources that a project can use. This helps system administrators to better manage and allocate resources across all projects. [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#set-project-quotas)

* **Tag Retention**

   A repository can rapidly accumulate a large number of image tags, many of which might not be required after a given time or once they have been superseded by a subsequent image build. These excess tags can obviously consume large quantities of storage capacity. As a system administrator, you can define rules that govern how many tags of a given repository to retain, or for how long to retain certain tags. [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#tag-retention-rules)

* **Webhooks**

   Webhooks allow for the integration of Harbor with other tools to streamline continuous integration and development processes.  Currently, webhooks can be configured for actions including container image push, container image pull, container image delete, helm chart push, helm chart pull, helm chart delete, image scanning completed, CVE discovered [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#webhook-notifications)

* **CVE Whitelists**

   As a system administrator, you can create exception policies of certain whitelisted CVEs to ignore during vulnerability policy checking. [Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#configure-cve-whitelists)

* **Replication Enhancements**

   This release includes the following improvements to replication:
   
   - Adds the ability to replicate resources between Harbor and Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Alibaba Cloud Container Registry, Helm Hub.
   - Supports filtering by Harbor labels
   - Supports configuring proxies
[Read more](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/docs/user_guide.md#replicating-resources)

* **Additional Features**

   Harbor 1.9 adds numerous other capabilities for both administrators and end-users:
   
   - Groups privileges prioritization: when an administrator privilege is granted to a user's group, but a guest privilege is also granted to the user, then the user has admin privileges.
   - Supports the configuration of an external syslog endpoint and database connection pools.
   - Security enhancement to make Harbor containers run as a non-root user.
   - Adds the ability to upload/fetch charts with robot accounts.
   - Bug Fixes and Improvements in job service: job retry, Redis pool run out, and the rapid growth in the amount of Redis data.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: We recommend that you skip the Harbor v1.7.1 release and install or upgrade to <a href="release-notes.html#v1.7.2">Harbor v1.7.2</a>.</p>

VMware Harbor Registry v1.7.1 is a general availability release with several new features and fixes.

### New Features

* Support for [Harbor Registry Release-1.7.0](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Release-1.7.0).

* The parameter `registry` is added by default and does not have to be added manually to the `no_proxy` field for Clair proxy configuration.

### Known Issues

When upgrading from Harbor v1.6.0 to v1.7.1, the upgrade procedure may fail with the following error message: `1 of 3 pre-start scripts failed. Failed Jobs: harbor.` The workaround is to log in to the Harbor VM with BOSH and check the Docker images. If there are any Docker images found for `vmware/harbor-log`, remove the images before migration. After removing the images, click **Apply Changes** in Ops Manager and retry the upgrade. This issue is addressed in Harbor v1.7.2. 

For guidance on logging in to the Harbor VM using BOSH, see [Managing PKS Deployments with BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/manage-deployments-bosh.html).

See the following example commands to check for Docker images in `vmare/harbor-log`:
    
```
alias docker='/var/vcap/packages/docker/bin/docker -H unix:///var/vcap/sys/run/docker/dockerd.sock'
docker images | grep vmware/harbor-log
```

See the following example command to remove any Docker images found for `vmware/harbor-log`:

```    
docker rmi IMAGES-ID-OF-VMWARE/HARBOR-LOG
```
