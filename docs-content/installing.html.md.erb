This topic describes how to install and configure VMware Harbor Registry using Pivotal Ops Manager for use with Pivotal Container Service (PKS) and Pivotal Application Service (PAS). After you install and configure Harbor, you must provide the Harbor CA certificate to Ops Manager.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This documentation supports the Harbor v1.6 release.</p>


## <a id='install'></a> Install VMware Harbor Registry

1. Download the Harbor tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Below the **Import a Product** button, click the **+** button next to the VMware Harbor Registry version number to add the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the **Harbor** tile to begin the configuration process. 


## <a id='configure'></a> Configure VMware Harbor Registry

This section describes Harbor configuration settings. If you make changes, be sure to click **Save**.

### <a id='configure_az_networks'></a> Configure AZ and Network Assignments

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**. 

1. Select the availability zone (AZ) to **place singleton jobs in**. VMware Harbor is a singleton job and will be placed on this network.

1. Select the AZ where to **balance other jobs in**. For PKS, this will be the same AZ as the singleton.

1. For **Network**, select the network on which to deploy Harbor. For PKS, this will be the management network where you deploy control plane components (Ops Manager, BOSH Director, PKS).

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='configure_general'></a> Configure General Settings

1. Click **General**.

1. Enter a **Hostname** (FDQN, not IP) to access the Harbor administration UI and registry service. For example: `harbor.mycompany.com`.
  <br><br>
  The hostname must include a domain and must be able to resolve to the IP of the Harbor instance VM by an external DNS server. 
  <br><br>
  Kubernetes worker nodes are able to resolve the Harbor FQDN via the local BOSH DNS server. So that Docker clients external to Kubernetes worker nodes can resolve the Harbor FQDN, you must provide a Harbor FQDN that is resolvable by an external DNS server. When Harbor is successfully deployed, you will need to update the Harbor external DNS record with IP address of the Harbor VM.

1. To use the default container network settings, choose the option **Keep the default container network settings**. 

1. To customize the container network settings, choose the option **Specify customized container network settings**.
  <br><br> 
  You must specify at least one address pool base and size. The address pool is used when a Docker container starts. The Docker daemon (dockerd) will allocate an IP address to this container; the IP address that is assigned is selected from the address pool.

1. Enter the **Address pool1 base**. For example, `172.80.0.0/16`.

1. Enter the **Address pool1 size**. For example, `24`. 

1. (Optional) Enter the **Address pool2 base**.

1. (Optional) Enter the **Address pool2 size**. 

1. (Optional) Enter the **Address pool3 base**.

1. (Optional) Enter the **Address pool3 size**. 

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='configure_certificate'></a> SSL Certificate Key Configuration

At the **Certificate** page, you configure the SSL certificate and private key for Harbor. You can generate the certificate and private key or provide a custom signed certificate and private key. You also need to provide the CA cert, which is used to sign the Harbor certificate. The domain name used to generate RSA certificate in the Harbor Tile can be different than the domain name used to generate the RSA certificate in the PKS or PAS tile.

1. Click **Certificate**. 

1. Do either of the following:
  - To use a certificate that Ops Manager generates automatically, do the following:
     1. Click **Generate RSA Certificate**.
     1. Enter a domain name wildcard in the **Generate RSA Certificate** field. The domain name wildcard must match the DNS resolvable domain name that you used when you specified the hostname for Harbor. For example, if you set the Harbor hostname to `harbor.mycompany.com`, enter `*.mycompany.com` in the **Generate RSA Certificate** field. 
     1. Click **Generate**.
  - To use a custom signed certificate from a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), do the following:
     1. Paste the contents of the certificate file into the **Certificate Authority (CA)** field. Certificates must be in PEM-encoded format. The certificate CN or SAN must match the DNS-resolvable domain name that you used when you specified the hostname for Harbor.
     1. Paste the contents of the corresponding key (PEM) into the **Private Key PEM** field.<br><br>          

1. Enter the **Certificate Authority (CA)** for the server certificate, which is used to sign the Harbor certificate. If you are using self-signed certificate, paste the corresponding CA here. Leave this field empty if you are using the root CA of Ops Manager.

1. Click **Save**.

### <a id='configure_clair'></a> Clair Configuration Settings

[Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair) is an open-source project for the static analysis of vulnerabilities in Docker and appc containers. Harbor provides the ability to install and use Clair for vulnerability scanning of container images. Clair can be configured to update its Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database from the Internet by setting the **Updater Interval**. In an intranet network environment, configure a proxy to access the Internet.

1. Click **Clair Settings**. 

1. (Optional) To enable container image vulnerability scanning, ensure **Install Clair** is selected.
If you deselect this checkbox, Clair is not installed.

1. (Optional) In the **HTTP Proxy** field, enter the URL for the HTTP proxy for the Clair service. For example: `http://your-proxy.example.com:3128`.

1. (Optional) In the **HTTPS Proxy** field, enter the URL for the HTTPS proxy for the Clair service.
   For example: `https://your-proxy.example.com:3128`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To use basic authentication with the HTTP/S proxy for Clair,
       include the user name and password in the proxy host URL,
       for example: <code>http://user:password@myproxy.internal.domain:8080</code>.</p>

1. In the **No Proxy** field, specify the endpoints that will not be proxied. This field is required if Clair is installed. The default values, `127.0.0.1,localhost,ui`, are populated for you.

1. In the **Updater interval (Hours)** field, specify when Clair will update its CVE database for the registered sources. When the updater interval expires, Clair will update its CVE database. If the updater interval is set to `0` (default), Clair will not update its CVE database.

1. Click **Save**.
