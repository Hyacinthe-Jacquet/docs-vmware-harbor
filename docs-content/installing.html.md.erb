This topic describes how to install and configure the VMware Harbor Registry.
After you install and configure Harbor, you must provide the Harbor CA certificate to Ops Manager.

1. Download the file for the Harbor tile from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file. 

1. Below the **Import a Product** button, click the **+** button next to the VMware Harbor Registry version number to add the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the **Harbor** tile. 

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**. 

1. Select the **Network** on which to deploy Harbor.

1. Click **Save**.

1. For **Network**, select the network on which to deploy Harbor.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='configure_general'></a> General Page

1. Click **General**.

1. Enter a **Hostname** (FDQN, not IP) to use for the Harbor host.
   The hostname must include a domain and must be able to resolve to the IP of the Harbor instance VM by the DNS server.

###<a id='configure_certificate'></a> Certificate Page

     1. Click **Change**.
     1. Click **Generate RSA Certificate**.
     1. Enter a domain name wildcard in the **Generate RSA Certificate** field.
        The domain name wildcard must match the DNS resolvable domain name
        that you used when you specified the hostname for Harbor. For example, if you set the Harbor hostname to `harbor.mycompany.com`,
        enter `*.mycompany.com` in the **Generate RSA Certificate** field. 
     1. Click **Generate**.
  - To use a custom signed certificate from a third-party Certificate Authority (CA), perform the following steps:
      1. Paste the contents of the certificate file into the **Certificate Authority (CA)** field.
         Certificates must be in PEM-encoded format.
         The certificate CN or SAN must match the DNS-resolvable domain name
         that you used when you specified the hostname for Harbor.
      1. Paste the contents of the corresponding key (PEM) into the **Private Key PEM** field.<br><br>          

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='configure_credentials'></a> Credentials Page
